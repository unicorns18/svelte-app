Frontend:
    Svelte: This is a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It compiles your code to tiny, framework-less vanilla JavaScript, which results in faster load times and a smoother user experience.

Backend:
    Flask: 
    This is a micro web framework written in Python. It's lightweight and easy to use, and it's a great choice for small to medium-sized applications.

Database:
    MongoDB: 
    This is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. You can use PyMongo, a Python driver, to interact with MongoDB.

APIs:

The Movie Database (TMDb) API: This is a community built movie and TV database. It's a great resource for any kind of movie and TV show data and includes a wide variety of metadata.

    OMDb API: 
    The Open Movie Database API is a free web service to obtain movie information. While it doesn't provide as much data as TMDb, it does have the advantage of providing IMDb IDs, which can be very useful.

Implementation Strategy:

    Frontend: 
    Use Svelte to build your UI components. Svelte has its own state management solution built-in, so you don't need an additional library like Redux.

    Backend: 
    Use Flask to create your server. This server will communicate with the TMDb and OMDb APIs to fetch movie and TV show data. You can use Flask's request object to access the data sent from the frontend.

    Database: 
    Use MongoDB to store user data and any other data you might need to persist. This could include user preferences, search history, etc. Use PyMongo to interact with MongoDB from your Flask application.

    APIs: 
    Use the TMDb API to fetch most of your movie and TV show data. This will likely involve making requests to various endpoints depending on the specific data you need. Use the OMDb API to fetch IMDb IDs for your movies and TV shows.
